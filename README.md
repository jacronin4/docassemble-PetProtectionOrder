## Framing 

When I first started working on this project, I was having difficulty to figure out the problem that is caused with having to fill out a Pet Protection Order. It seemed simple, if an individual is a party in an exisiting case or there has been an issued judgment in a case where they were a party, and that case was regarding a restraining order, an individual whether the plaintiff or the defendant in that original case could file this petition relative to domesticated animals. Then I remembered I go to law school and understand the language being used. Even reading the document, I really had to think with how it operates and what the individual could request. For instance the order can be for multiple animals, one of which the individual is requesting the court to grant them possession, the other the individual is asking the court to order the other party to refrain from taking some action towards the animal. It is not clear what type of claim can be made by this order. While lawyers completing this form for clients may know the specifics of how the form works, individuals who cannot afford or may not have frequent access to legal counsel for their case would have difficulty understanding the form. Further, legal aid organizations who have a lot of clients, but not a lot of time may find it difficult to sit with clients and explain the process and purpose of this confusing form. 

## Research 

I briefly mentioned the current solutions above, but will go into further detail. For those who can afford a lawyer and have frequent access to them, they can have the lawyer complete the form for them, or sit with their lawyer while completing the form in order to understand the process further. Legal aid organizations could do the same, but as we have heard from our guest speakers there is too much need, and not enough time or personnel to meet this need. One solution could be something similar to what we heard from Professor Steenhuis, one day a week hold a clinic which the entire time you help people to fill out this form. But as we heard, this only partially meets the need. Additionally, on the Lit Labs Court Forms Bank, the individual could fill out the form as a pdf, but as I explained it is difficult to understand what request can be made and how to use the form. In this situation I see it as very possible an individual could fill out the form incorrectly and jeapordize their claim.

## Ideation & Prototyping

I thought about this often when constructing my interview, considering what I like to call the simple complexity of the Pet Protect Order form. Considering this simple complexity I felt I could have gone in various directions when constructing the interview. At one point I considered scrapping questions regarding obtaining a hearing regarding the Pet Protection Order. I felt this section caused confusion and the one completing the form could benefit from this being absent. Then I considered the cost, the individual would have to fill the section out anyway, and instead I should clarify the purpose of this section when constructing the interview. I considered this form to split into three sections, the first being the information about the underlying case, the second being the information specific to the protection of domesticated animals, and the third being the section regarding whether the individual obtained a hearing regarding the pet protection order. My first thought was to explain the sections of the form at the beginning of the interview in the intro screen. The benefit of this would be that the person would see the process of the form before they even started the interview. The cost would be that they could not go back to these instructions very easily throughout the interview. The other option was to still have this information at the start of the interview, but to also have the informational screens before the first question of each section, again outlying the process and purpose of each section. The benefit would be that the information would be readily available throughout the interview, the cost being an individual who may understand the form would find it annoying to have this information keep appearing. However, I believe in this situation the benefit of this strategy greatly outweighs the cost.
