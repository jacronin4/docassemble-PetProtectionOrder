## Framing 

When I first started working on this project, I was having difficulty to figure out the problem that is caused with having to fill out a Pet Protection Order. It seemed simple, if an individual is a party in an exisiting case or there has been an issued judgment in a case where they were a party, and that case was regarding a restraining order, an individual whether the plaintiff or the defendant in that original case could file this petition relative to domesticated animals. Then I remembered I go to law school and understand the language being used. Even reading the document, I really had to think with how it operates and what the individual could request. For instance the order can be for multiple animals, one of which the individual is requesting the court to grant them possession, the other the individual is asking the court to order the other party to refrain from taking some action towards the animal. It is not clear what type of claim can be made by this order. While lawyers completing this form for clients may know the specifics of how the form works, individuals who cannot afford or may not have frequent access to legal counsel for their case would have difficulty understanding the form. Further, legal aid organizations who have a lot of clients, but not a lot of time may find it difficult to sit with clients and explain the process and purpose of this confusing form. 

## Research 

I briefly mentioned the current solutions above, but will go into further detail. For those who can afford a lawyer and have frequent access to them, they can have the lawyer complete the form for them, or sit with their lawyer while completing the form in order to understand the process further. Legal aid organizations could do the same, but as we have heard from our guest speakers there is too much need, and not enough time or personnel to meet this need. One solution could be something similar to what we heard from Professor Steenhuis, one day a week hold a clinic which the entire time you help people to fill out this form. But as we heard, this only partially meets the need. Additionally, on the Lit Labs Court Forms Bank, the individual could fill out the form as a pdf, but as I explained it is difficult to understand what request can be made and how to use the form. In this situation I see it as very possible an individual could fill out the form incorrectly and jeapordize their claim. 
What are the existing solutions (technical and content-based solutions). 

## Ideation & Prototyping

I thought about this often when constructing my interview, considering what I like to call the simple complexity of the Pet Protect Order form. Considering this simple complexity I felt I could have gone in various directions when constructing the interview. At one point I considered scrapping questions regarding obtaining a hearing regarding the Pet Protection Order. I felt this section caused confusion and the one completing the form could benefit from this being absent. Then I considered the cost, the individual would have to fill the section out anyway, and instead I should clarify the purpose of this section when constructing the interview. I considered this form to split into three sections, the first being the information about the underlying case, the second being the information specific to the protection of domesticated animals, and the third being the section regarding whether the individual obtained a hearing regarding the pet protection order. My first thought was to explain the sections of the form at the beginning of the interview in the intro screen. The benefit of this would be that the person would see the process of the form before they even started the interview. The cost would be that they could not go back to these instructions very easily throughout the interview. The other option was to still have this information at the start of the interview, but to also have the informational screens before the first question of each section, again outlying the process and purpose of each section. The benefit would be that the information would be readily available throughout the interview, the cost being an individual who may understand the form would find it annoying to have this information keep appearing. However, I believe in this situation the benefit of this strategy greatly outweighs the cost.  
Consider the costs & benefits of the technical solutions or design configurations. Creates prototype after considering multiple alternatives. 

## User Testing 

While writing this biography I wished I had done more user testing. I sent a google form to eight people, two law students, two lawyers, two individuals not lawyers or law students, and two other people who did not want to identify their category. An example of taking user feedback is that one of the individuals who did not want to identify, asked me to change the google form for them, which I did. It turned out that another person I used for testing also did not want to identify. This is an example of how user testing can benefit the creator when they do not think of something and a respondent to the testing provides an important perspective which benefits other users as well. I randomly assigned each individual to either complete the docassemble interview or to try and fill out the pdf form in chrome or Adobe if they had those capabilities. I used a random number generator with the paramaters of 1-2, 1 being the docassemble interview, 2 being the pdf form.  
Makes use of at least one tester other than themselves for each type of user in close to real-world conditions. Captures user feedback in a uniform comparable manner. Student provides copy of user feedback. 

OR 

Fails to make use of a tester other than themselves; or fails to replicate close to real-world conditions; or fails to capture user feedback in a uniform manner. 

## Refinement 

User feedback is seriously considered and used to inform the final version of the solution (where the solution includes both the technical product and any documentation). The final version is not the same as the original versio (i.e., there are at least two versions). 

OR 

Fails to seriously consider user feedback in final version of solution or fails to create multiple iterations of the solution. 

## Complexity 

Involves non-trivial use of at least two of the following: an expert system; document automation; data scraping from a data source not in the student's control; a machine learning algorithm trained by the student. 

## Impact and Efficiencies 

Expands the reach of a single practitioner by more than 100 or decreases the amount of time expended on the automated task by more than 50%. Expanded reach must account for all work flowing from the solution such that this work will not result in new work for a practitioner. That is, it assumes the practitioner is already working at full capacity. So increased lead generation doesn't count. More efficient selection of high-value clients, however, can count when this is reasonably projected to lead to a more than 5% increase in revenue. 

## Fitness and Completeness 

Produces viable output. UI is intuitive / well-documented. Directly addresses the stated problem for the stated user types such that it is reasonable to assume almost all users of any user type would find the solution a great improvement over the status quo in nearly all conceivable use cases. 

OR 

Produces viable output. UI is intuitive / well-documented. In broad terms, the solution address the stated problem for the stated user types such that it is reasonable to assume most users of any user type would find the solution an improvement over the status quo excpet for a small set of edge cases. 
## Real World Viability 

Ready for real-world use as is. This includes working technical solution and all supporting documentation. It need not include placement on a server or user authentication 

OR 

Identifies what steps are needed before real-world use, and such steps are estimated by the instructors to be less than two day's work, exluding placement on a server or user authentication. 

## Sustainability 

There is a clear plan for continued operation, updates, and maintenance, and the aprtner seems ready and willing to implement it.
